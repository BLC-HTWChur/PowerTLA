PowerTLA
========

PowerTLA aims to be a reference implementation for the ADL Training and Learning Architecture for mobile and web-based 
learning. It offers a light weight integration layer for Learning Management Systems (or other HR management frameworks)
that allows the use of the new functions in online courses on existing platforms. 

Currently the ILIAS LMS (www.ilias.de) is supported. 

PowerTLA offers a REST service layer for 

 * Authentication using OAuth 1
 * Experience API 
 * IMS QTI JSON binding
 * Learner profile service
 
 PowerTLA builds ontop of the existing LMS code and allows easy integration of mobile tools and services.

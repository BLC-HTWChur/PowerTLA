# PowerTLA


PowerTLA aims to be a reference implementation for the ADL Training and Learning Architecture (TLA) for mobile and web-based
learning. It offers a light weight integration layer for Learning Management Systems (or other HR management frameworks)
that allows the use of the new functions in online courses on existing platforms.

Currently the ILIAS LMS (www.ilias.de) is supported.

PowerTLA offers a REST service layer for

* Authentication using OAuth 1 (TODO)
* Experience API (in progress)
* IMS QTI JSON binding (TODO)
* Learner profile service (TODO)

PowerTLA builds on top of the existing LMS code and allows easy integration of mobile tools and services.

## Install

### ILIAS LMS

On Ilias create a folder in the root directory called "tla".

Then copy all powertla files into this directory. The rest will work like magik.
